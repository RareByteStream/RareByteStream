## Projects:
  * None released yet.

## About Me:
     
  * Context: This profile is tailored primarily for Github and open-source community, rather than for observers from professional networks. It should be understood as more of a **personal self introduction**. It serves to save time by providing information.
 
  * I am passionate about Software Development/Engineering with strong emphasis on **Custom GUI Development**, **Custom TUI Development** and **User Interface Engineering** on the client side; **Local Networking**, **Sub-Processing** and **Filesystem Operations Programming** on server side. In general, I am slightly compulsive about performance and API Design convenience balance.
  
  * I have primarily worked on local-first applications but am proficient in database integration **when required** ( Future example: Integrating the distributed USDA food database to my GUI ).
  
  * I am interested in collaborating on any project that I can learn more about computer science and software engineering while also adding meaningful value. I am especially interested in contributing to open-source projects for that reason.
  
  * As a developer/engineer, I define myself as **Full-Cycle** rather than full-stack or front-end, committed to handling all problems from beginning to end. This is rooted in my own scientific pursuits and drive to streamline my scientific knowledge consumption hobby. I often find myself developing my own systems because of the high standards I have, —such as cloning components and the entire system for supporting a more performance or time critical functionality— and building the entire system with such scalability in mind in the beginning to avoid pitfalls. 


  
## Proficiencies: 
* Strong expertise in **JavaScript/Node.js**, capable of modifying or implementing libraries as needed per situation and especially for long term requirements.
* Intermediate to Strong expertise in **Bash for DevOps** Automation and Utility Scripting, especially with the built in language constructs.
* Beginner to Intermediate familiarty with **Java** for **GUI** and **Server** development I also have experience working with ProcessBuilder and related classes.
* Strong expertise with developing applications on top of GUI Engines such as **Blink/SpiderMonkey**, **Blink/Electron** and **JavaFX**. Especially at **Event Handling** and for custom behavior and appearance implementation, especially without relying on a framework or a library.
* Beginner to Intermediate familiarity with Python for anything not directly impactful to GUI Development.
* Familiarity with C, C++ due from conducting design and performance tests on them; build automation tools such as Make, CMake, Ninja etc as a result of building and installing the third party applications I dependend on, from their source.


## Pursuits/Goals ( Long Term, spanning to next 3-5 years ): 
* Deep grasp on the technical standards of EcmaScript, Python, Java, **C++** and **C** and their implementations for understanding the first three at a **closer to metal** level.
* GUI Development implmentations across mature & flexible libraries & frameworks ( ( CSS with ES6+ in Electron, Browsers, Cordova, React ), QT, React Native, Android API, "maybe" GTK+ and "maybe" QT6 ), [ordered from most proficient to least].
* Learning the scientific basis of algorithms behind GUI technologies we have today such as windowing systems and libraries that run on top of them. ( GTK, QT, Cairo, Pango etc. )
* Technical standards of MongoDB, SQL and other DBMS fo understanding efficient and safe data modeling and processing.
* Standards of HTTP Protocol across versions to have a strong grasp of world wide web.


  
## Contact Information: 
 * If we are discussing business or we are coworkers, 
  you can use my legal name. Otherwise use either my 
  github nickname or one of my github names ( Alex and/or Willer ). 
  I use and respect my legal name only in formal and legal contexts.
 * Preferred Languages: English, Other Indo European ( can translate indo european languages efficiently in text )
 * E-Mail Address: enesg.devel@gmail.com
