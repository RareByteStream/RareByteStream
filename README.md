## My Interest in Software:
  
  * I’m interested in Software Development/Engineering with high emphasis on GUI Development and User Interface Engineering for client side, local networking and filesystem level programming for low level operations. 
  My interest in databases are a little lower compared to those since I was only inclined to develop systems that are only intended for my personal use. Data storage can be performed in filesystem when it comes to programming solo so i never used dbms software as passionately as language runtime platforms themselves. 
  
  * I would be interested in collaborating on any project that i can learn more about computer science while also adding the necessary value.
  

  
## Personal Information: 
 * If we are discussing business or we are coworkers, 
  you can use my legal name. Otherwise use either my 
  github nickname or one of my github names ( Alex and/or Willer ). 
  I use my legal name only in formal and legal contexts.
 * Preferred Languages: English, German.

  
## Proficiencies: 
* EcmaScript 6+ in browsers and nodejs. ( Expert. i can hack or implement any library if the time is given. ).
* Bash for scripting/devops. ( Intermediate. Good essential level command of basic language features and linux utilities that can be used with it. ).
* Java ( Beginner. Only some experience with configuring jvm and developing GUIs with JavaFX ).
* Python ( Beginner to Intermediate depending on the task. Only some essential command of basic language features and patterns. ).


## Pursuits/Goals ( Long Term ): 
* Standards of EcmaScript, Java, Python, C++ and C.
* GUI Development best practices across mainstream high level frameworks ( CSS with ES6+ and HTML, Electron, JavaFX, Cordova, Android API ), [ordered from most proficient to least].
* Algorithms behind GUI technologies we have today such as windowing systems and libraries that run on top of them. ( GTK, QT, JavaFX, Cairo, Pango etc. I would study and experiment with anything that would enhance my understanding of the logic/algorithms. )
* Standards of MongoDB, SQL and databases in general.
* Standards of HTTP Protocol across versions.
