## My Interest in Software:
  
  * I’m interested in Software Development/Engineering with high emphasis on **Custom GUI Development** and **User Interface Engineering** on client side, and **Local Networking** and **Filesystem Ops Programming** on server side. 
  My interest in databases are a little lower compared to those since I was only inclined to develop systems that are only intended for my personal use. Data storage can be performed in filesystem when it comes to programming solo so i never used dbms software as passionately as language runtime platforms themselves. 
  
  * I would be interested in collaborating on any project that i can learn more about computer science while also adding the necessary value.
  

  
## Personal Information: 
 * If we are discussing business or we are coworkers, 
  you can use my legal name. Otherwise use either my 
  github nickname or one of my github names ( Alex and/or Willer ). 
  I use my legal name only in formal and legal contexts.
 * Preferred Languages: English, German.
 * I would define my proficiency/role as **Full-Cycle** rather than full stack or front end.
  
## Proficiencies: 
* EcmaScript 6+ in browsers and nodejs. ( Expert. I can hack or implement any library if the time is given. ).
* Bash for scripting/devops. ( Intermediate. Good essential level command of basic language features and linux utilities that can be used with it. ).
* Python ( Beginner to Intermediate depending on the task. Only some essential command of basic language features and patterns. ).


## Pursuits/Goals ( Long Term ): 
* Standards of EcmaScript, Java, Python, C++ and C.
* GUI Development best practices across mature & flexible libraries & frameworks ( ( CSS with ES6+ in Electron, Browsers, Cordova ), GTK ), [ordered from most proficient to least].
* Knowing the scientific basis of algorithms behind GUI technologies we have today such as windowing systems and libraries that run on top of them. ( GTK, QT, Cairo, Pango etc. )
* Standards of MongoDB, SQL and databases in general.
* Standards of HTTP Protocol across versions.
* Being proficient at implementing local networking mechanism such as IPC.
