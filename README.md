## My Interest in Software:
  
  * I’m interested in Software Development/Engineering with high emphasis on GUI Development and User Interface Engineering for client side, local networking and filesystem level programming for low level operations. 
  My interest in databases are a little lower compared to those since I was only inclined to develop systems that are only intended for my personal use. Data storage can be performed in filesystem when it comes to programming solo so i never used dbms software as passionately as language runtime platforms themselves. 
  
  * I would be interested in collaborating on any project that i can learn to do things better while also adding the necessary value. I wouldn't contribute to a project to learn something from scratch unless it's a very narrow scope where I can use my collateral experience to supply the new domain.
  

  
## Personal Information: 
 * If we are discussing business or we are coworkers, 
  you can use my legal name. Otherwise use either my 
  github nickname or one of my github names ( first or second ). 
  I use my legal name in formal and legal contexts only.
