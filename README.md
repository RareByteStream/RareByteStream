## About Me:
  
  * I am passionate about Software Development/Engineering with high emphasis on **Custom GUI Development** and **User Interface Engineering** on the client side; and **Local Networking**, **Sub-Processing** and **Filesystem Ops Programming** on server side. 
  
  * I have primarily worked on local-first applications but am proficient in database integration "when required".
  
  * I am interested in collaborating on any project that I can learn more about computer science and software engineering while also adding the necessary value. I am especially interested in contribution to Open Source projects for that reason.
  
  * As a developer I define myself as **Full-Cycle** rather than full-stack or front-end. This is rooted in my own scientific pursuits and streamlining them. I always had to develop my own systems because of the high standards I have got, such as cloning a component for supporting a more performance or time critical functionality.
    
  * Context: This profile is tailored primarily for Github and Open Source community, not for professional networks.


  
## Proficiencies: 
* Strong expertise in **JavaScript/Node.js**, capable of modifying or implementing libraries as needed per situation and especially per long term requirements.
* Strong expertise in Bash for DevOps Automation and Utility Scripting.
* Strong expertise with developing applications on top of GUI Engines such as **Blink/SpiderMonkey**, **Blink/Electron** and **JavaFX**. Especially at **Event Handling** and for custom behavior and appearance implementation.
* **Strong Familiarity** and **Intermediate proficiency** with **Python** and **Java** for anything not directly impactful to GUI Development.
* Familiarity with C, C++ and build automation tools such as Make, CMake, Ninja etc as a result of building and installing the third party applications I dependend on, from their source.


## Pursuits/Goals ( Long Term ): 
* Deep grasp on the technical standards of EcmaScript, Python, Java, C++, Rust and C.
* GUI Development best practices across mature & flexible libraries & frameworks ( ( CSS with ES6+ in Electron, Browsers, Cordova ), React, Android API, GTK ), [ordered from most proficient to least].
* Learning the scientific basis of algorithms behind GUI technologies we have today such as windowing systems and libraries that run on top of them. ( GTK, QT, Cairo, Pango etc. )
* Technical standards of MongoDB, SQL and other DBMS.
* Standards of HTTP Protocol across versions to have a strong grasp of world wide web.


  
## Contact Information: 
 * If we are discussing business or we are coworkers, 
  you can use my legal name. Otherwise use either my 
  github nickname or one of my github names ( Alex and/or Willer ). 
  I use my legal name only in formal and legal contexts.
 * Preferred Languages: English, German.
 * E-Mail Address: In the profile.
